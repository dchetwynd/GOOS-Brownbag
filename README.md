This is a lunchtime brownbag presentation that I gave for my ThoughtWorks colleagues on the wonderful "Growing Object-Oriented Software Guided by Tests" (GOOS) book:

GOOS is an intermediate/advanced Test-Driven Development book that shows how to create an object-oriented codebase in a test-driven way, starting off with acceptance tests for new features from the application end users. The book uses Java code examples and features a lot of information on how to use mock objects well in Test-Driven Development.
